Here is the updated changelog including the new changes.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

* possible NPE when collecting player network metrics #10 (@bzed)
* metrics cleanup for Expansion vehicles on deletion #11 (@bzed)
* Expansion AI "Invalid FSM": `ScriptLog` events are no longer counted in
  `dayz_metricz_events_total`, handling them broke `ScriptModule.LoadScript()`

## [0.4.1][] - 2026-03-27

### Added

* Metric **`dayz_metricz_chat_messages_total`** (`COUNTER`) —
  Total messages sent by players in the world

### Changed

* refactor string concatenation and loops increment to improve performance
* fixed possible NPE in `EntitiesWriter`

### Fixed

* Removed `EngineIsOn()` in `ExpansionVehicleBase` replaced with
  `Expansion_EngineIsOn()`

[0.4.1]: https://github.com/WoozyMasta/metricz/compare/0.4.0...0.4.1

## [0.4.0][] - 2025-12-17

### Added

* API for 3rd party mods integration `MetricZ_Exporter.Register`
* implemented Collectors registration and framed Flush, which allows
  processing each individual block of metrics in different server frames
* prevent overriding reserved Prometheus labels
* configuration has been completely moved to a new format in the JSON file
  `$profile:metricz/config.json` ⚠️
* metrics are now exported to a separate directory `$profile:metricz/export/` ⚠️
* buffered metric export is now available in all metrics sink writers
* configuration option `http.serialized` to enable native C++ JSON
  serialization for HTTP payloads, reducing execution time from x4-x5 times
* support for sending metrics to the proxy and aggregation backend
  [metrics-exporter](https://github.com/woozymasta/metricz-exporter)
* basic telemetry sending
* implemented `MetricZ_PersistentCache` to save and load unique sets of
  tags between server restarts, which will fix Prometheus rate calculations
* configuration options `disabled_metrics.hits`, `thresholds.hit_damage` and
  `thresholds.hit_damage_vehicle` to control entity hit metrics
* configuration option `disabled_metrics.kills` to disable
  player and zombie/animal kill source metrics
* debug logging of all configuration values when `DIAG` is defined
* `MetricZ_Geo` helper class for converting world coordinates to `EPSG:4326`
  (WGS84).
* new config/CLI `geo.world_effective_size` options to override map tiles size
* new config options `disabled_metrics.areas` and
  `disabled_metrics.local_areas`
* new config options `disabled_metrics.positions_height` and
  `disabled_metrics.positions_yaw`

  autodetected values

### Changed

* caching labels strings wherever possible and squeezing out
  maximum performance
* sink writers have been implemented for writing metrics to disk,
  sending them over the network, or both simultaneously
* for file export, atomic write mode is now optional (but recommended)
* updated `MetricZ_Helpers::GetInstanceID` logic: if `instanceId` is missing
  in server config, it now attempts to use the Game Port or Steam Query Port
  as a fallback before defaulting to "0"
* fixed an issue when trying to calculate network ping for eAI
* fixed double counting of destroyed vehicles when saving/loading
* stricter `EEKilled()` checking for objects deaths
  to prevent unnecessary counter increments
* fixed calculation of `dayz_metricz_(boats|cars|helicopters)` and
  `dayz_metricz_(boats|cars|helicopters)_destroyed_total` with installed
  Expansion Vehicles mod
* fixed calculation of `dayz_metricz_players_spawns_total`
* fixed `dayz_metricz_artillery_barrages_total` calculation logic
* removed `dayz_metricz_weapon_shots_all_total` ⚠️
* removed `dayz_metricz_player_third_person`,
  which was only available on the client side
* weapon type name for labels now use `MetricZ_ObjectName::GetName()`
* `MetricZ_ObjectName::StripSuffix()` now returns bool on success and
  accepts an `inout` type name
* fixed **`dayz_metricz_artillery_barrages_total`** calculation logic
* replaced `MetricZ_EnableCoordinatesMetrics` with inverted
  `MetricZ_DisableCoordinatesMetrics` (`-metricz-disable-coordinates`) ⚠️
* coordinate metrics now use `MetricZ_Geo` and can export either raw world
  coordinates or WGS84 lon/lat based on
  `geo.disable_transform_coordinates` ⚠️
* labels for **`dayz_metricz_territory_lifetime`** changed: replaced
  `x`/`y`/`z` with `longitude`/`latitude` and added `refresher_radius` ⚠️
* documentation rendering in `CONFIG.md` has been updated and improved
* configuration reading has been normalized and brought to a unified form
* frame monitor moved to `DayZGame::OnPostUpdate()` for more stable
  calculations (if frame skipping is used by mods like GaneZ)
* spelling in panel names have been corrected
